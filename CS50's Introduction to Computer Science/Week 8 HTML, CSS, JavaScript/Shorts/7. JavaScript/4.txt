Events
• An event in HTML and JavaScript is a response to user interaction with the web page.
--> A user clicks a button, a page has finished loading, a user has hovered over a portion of the page, the user typed in an input field.
• JavaScript has support for event handlers, which are callback functions that respond to HTML events.
--> Many HTML elements have support for events as an attribute.

<html>
    <head>
        <title>Event Handlers</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <button onclick="">Button 1</button>
        <button onclick="">Button 2</button>
    </body>
</html>

• We can write a generic event handler in JavaScript, creating an event object, that will tell us which of these two buttons was clicked.


<html>
    <head>
        <title>Event Handlers</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <button onclick="alertName(event)">Button 1</button>
        <button onclick="alertName(event)">Button 2</button>
    </body>
</html>

function alertName(event)
{
var trigger = event.srcElement;
alert('You clicked on ' + trigger.innerHTML);
}
