Including JavaScript in your HTML

. Just like CSS with <style> tags, you can directly write your JavaScript between <script> tags.

. Just like CSS with <link> tags, you can write your JavaScript in separate files and link them in by using the src attribute of the <script> tag.



Variables

JavaScript variables are similar to PHP variables.
• No type specifier.
• When a local variable is first declared, preface with the var keyword.
($x = 44;) wrong
(var x = 44;) correct



Conditionals
• All of the old favorites from C are still available for you to use.
if
else if
else
switch
?:



Loops
• All of the old favorites from C are still available for you to use.
while
do-while
for



Functions
• All functions are introduced with the function keyword.
• JavaScript functions, particularly those bound specifically to HTML elements, can be anonymous—you don't have to give them a name!



Arrays
. Declaring an array is pretty straightforward.
var nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var mixed = [1,
            true,
            3.333,
            'five'];



Objects
• JavaScript has the ability to behave as an object-oriented programming language.
• An object is sort of analogous to a C structure
• C structures contain a number of fields, which we might also call properties.
• But the properties themselves can not ever stand on their own
• Objects, meanwhile, have properties but also methods, or functions that are inherent to the object, and mean nothing outside of it.
• Thus, like properties can methods not ever stand on their own.

function(object);   -- wrong
object.function();  -- correct

The fields and methods of an object are similar in spirit to the idea of an associative array, with which we're familiar from PHP.
