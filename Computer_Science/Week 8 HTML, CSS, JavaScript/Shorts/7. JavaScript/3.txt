Functions (redux)
• Arrays are a special case of an object (in fact, everything in JavaScript is a special case of an object), and has numerous methods that can applied to them:
-->array.size(), array.pop(), array.push(x), array.shift();
• There is also a method for arrays called map(), which can be used to apply a function to all elements of an array.
-->A great situation to use an anonymous function

var nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

nums = nums.map(function(num) {
    return num * 2;
});

result 
var nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
